# LIT Notes

Getting set up with llvm's testing system (LIT) to test target features. We need tests in the following directories (llvm-project/llvm/test/):

- CodeGen: test code generation for various llvm operations, calling convention, inline assembly, pseudo instructions, etc
- MC: compiling pure assembly (all instruction encodings), fixups? 

There's a ton to write it seems, so first things first:

In MC, we really just are handling machine code level stuff: for every instruction, create a test that checks all forms of the instruction, compile them, check the encoding, dissassemble and check that we get the same result. Once we are building a full-fledged PASM parser, we will need more tests, but that comes later

In CodeGen, we can probably copy a lot from arm, avr, and other targets. 

Binary operator tests:
1. add, sub, mul, udiv, sdiv, urem, srem, 

Bitwise operator tests:
1. shl, lshr, ashr, and, or, xor, 

Memory tests
1. alloca
1. load
1. store

Conversion
1. trunc..to
1. zext..to
1. sext..to

Comparison
1. icmp
1. select

Termination
1. br
1. indirectdr
1. switch
