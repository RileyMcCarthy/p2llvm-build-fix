# Function Caching

It would be very nice to be able to run some functions in the cog without starting a new cog (when running in hub mode). To do this in the most flexible way, we'll use the cog RAM as a function cache and mark those functions that should be cached with the "cogtext" attribute (maybe change it to "fcache"?). When calling a cogtext function, we'll set up for a complete function call as usual, but instead of calling the function, we'll place the address of the function into `pa`, the size of the function into `pb` and call an intermediate function that will 
1. look to see if this function is loaded into the function cache
2. if so, call it
3. if not, load it into the cache and then call it. 

This function cache loader function should live in LUT ram just like any other runtime library function (if it will fit... might need to write it in assembly directly?). 

How the function cache will operate: 
1. maintain a map of hub addresses -> (cog addresses, size in cog ram) to know where things are in the cache
2. on entry to our cache loading function, check if the hub address is in our map
3. if it is: cache hit: read the corresponding cog address and call it. 
4. if it is not: cache miss: get the next free cog address (need to keep adding up sizes as we search the cache), use a rdfast to load the desired address into that free cog address (assuming there's enough space). Call it. If not enough space to load, go back to the begining of the cache and overwrite that function and any hub addresses it affects in the cache map

Implementation phases: 
1. maintain a 1-entry cache map. That is, every time a new function is desired, it must be loaded and the old one discarded. 
2. expand the map to 464 entries (one for every possible cog address in it's worst case where every function is just a `reta`). Load functions one after another, ignoring what happens when you run out of space
3. handle running out of space by looping around the cache.

One thing to decide still: should we use fixed size slots and just track what the slot contains? Might make implementation simpler but reduces flexibility. 

Cache map organization:
- each entry is 4 hub longs in size.
- store in somewhere in BSS so it's cleared on boot
- long 0 is the key: a non-zero value is a hub address, a 0 is an empty entry, and a -1 (0xffffffff) is a special value we'll use in the future
- long 1 is the corresponding 9 bit cog address where this function has been loaded
- long 2 is the size of the function in longs. 
- long 3 is reserved for future use

Testing:
- Develop a set of functions with a lot of branches (the main reason to cache these functions) and some that use the streamer
- time how long it takes to run the functions with and without caching
- make sure the streamer works.
