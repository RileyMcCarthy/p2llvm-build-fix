# Examples

This is some simple documentation/notes on the examples provided by P2LLVM. All are written for the P2-ES Rev B Evaluation Board. Some examples will use additional eval board accesories.

To build any example, simply run it's corresponding `make` file. They require that the P2LLVM system is installed in `/opt/p2llvm` and `loadp2` is in the system PATH. If these are different on your system, adjust the Makefile to match your setup.

## 1. blink

Most basic example, blink an LED on pin 56

## 2. cogs

Start three cogs to blink LEDs at different rates. Classic Propeller multicore example

## 3. serial

Demonstrates using the C library for printing to serial

## 4. math

Demonstrates the math libcalls generated by LLVM's P2 backend. Eventually, it should be expanded to include floats and more complex math operations

## 5. files

TBD what else to do to demo the file structure, but I'll come up with something

## 6. objects

Demonstrate C++ objects and using them as modules that can run in cogs, as well as allocation memory on the heap (which should generally be avoided)

## 7. smartpins

Demonstrate doing interesting things with P2 smart pins
