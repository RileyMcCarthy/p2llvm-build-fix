# Introduction

P2LLVM is a project to bring Propeller 2 into the industrial and professional world by providing a modern C/C++ toolchain based around LLVM. LLVM is a flexible compiler system designed perform as many of its compilation actions as possible in a target-independant manner, converting to the final target-specific instructions at the last possible moment. This allows Propeller to take advantage of the many years of effort put into clang and LLVM to create advanced and optimized code with complex structures, with only a minimal amount of effort necessary to create a new toolchain.
